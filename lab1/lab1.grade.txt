  cp:
   - need to check for errors from read(), write() -2
   - missing close() statements -3

   - can just check for argc != 3
   - set destination permissions directly (is easier):
      open(argv[2], O_CREAT|O_WRONLY, ret.st_mode);

  ls:
   - need to break line for directories with a lot of files (short mode) -1
