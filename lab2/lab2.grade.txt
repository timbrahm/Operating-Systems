  client:
    - getopt() should be it's own block of code. not enclosing your
      entire program. -3
      what if -p wasn't passed to client? this is legal.
    - sockaddr_in s_addr cannot bet set to INADDR_ANY (this is for server-side) -2
      use gethostbyname():  memcpy(&sa.sin_addr.s_addr, host->h_addr, host->h_length);
    - need to close sfd at program exit -1

  server:
    - getopt() should be it's own block of code. not enclosing your
      entire program.
